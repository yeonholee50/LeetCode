# LeetCode

I started this repository not because I have a particular fondness for interview questions, but because I find solving these problems enjoyable. While I have felt nervous leading up to interviews—which I believe is normal—these problems and puzzles have solutions, and there are different ways of approaching them.

Many people argue that coding interviews are irrelevant beyond the interview process itself. However, I hold a different perspective: I believe they remain indicative of performance in on-site interviews, which are becoming increasingly common. Technical questions simulate real-world scenarios—they reveal how one collaborates, reasons through problems, whether they plan before coding or jump straight in, whether they ask clarifying questions when requirements are unclear, and how they define scope, among other things.

For me, solving one to four of these puzzle problems from time to time is genuinely enjoyable. The process of clarifying requirements, identifying the questions I would ask, and having fun while preparing is, in my opinion, the ideal approach to interview preparation. If you can find enjoyment in the process, I encourage you to do so.

Please note that my solutions may not represent the best or most optimal approaches. There are often better ways to implement solutions, and I welcome feedback and alternative perspectives.

The best way to learn is to work through these problems yourself. The experience is fundamentally different when you engage with them directly.
